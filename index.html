            <p class="justifier">I am now a programmer, but that has not always been the case, I have a background with
                teaching, working on industry and hospital with a Chemistry degree in UNESP (2014). I have been
                studying for a couple years and always identified myself as having a step into the technology world, but
                just
                now I decided I had to pursue this path. I am currently studying Analisys and development of systems at
                UniCesumar. I love my family and enjoy movies, series and games.

                <h3>Webdeveloper stack</h3>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> I started learning webdev with the course of Cristina Yu, which I took
                    lessons
                    about HTML and CSS until the start of Bootstrap, that's when I decided to start Javascript instead
                    and get my
                    feet wet. Which I instantly fell in love with, it's freedom, syntax, the way it's "compiled" and
                    it's gimmics, I left HTML and CSS a bit aside when I started learning it, and as deep as I go into
                    it, the
                    more Ienjoy it... Understanding how a call stack work, hoisting, lexical envoirement, callbacks,
                    map, reduce
                    and filter functions implementions;the way Javascript lets you program in a functional way is
                    incredible.
                    Currently I am in the middle of a course of zero to Master in Javascript by Jonas Schmedtmann and
                    following
                    losely The Odin Project's lectures; since they started asking for spread and rest stuff, I left it a
                    bit aside
                    until I catch up with the Jonas course; currently learning how the code is compiled and interpreted
                    at the
                    same time (JIT) while doing some lecture projects... My plan currently is to finish both Jonas's and
                    TOP's
                    course and starting advanced CSS course</p>

                <h3>The MERN stack</h3>

                <p style="text-align: justify">Since I fell in love so much with Javascript, that's the path I decided
                    to follow
                    as a developer for the time
                    being, because with that I am able to fully get deep in this language's knowledge. Once I finish
                    studying my
                    current courses, I will start learning React as my JS framework. In order to be self-suficient in
                    the
                    fullstack, I want to run Node.js with Express.js while using MongoDB as database; to learn that I am
                    probably
                    going to take the University of Helsink course; Full Stack Open. With that completing the three
                    tiers needed
                    to run applications: Front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js),
                    and
                    database tier (MongoDB).</p>

                    projects
                    aside a bit since I am studying how Javascript engine works, so I am just doing some simple
                    exercises to
                    enforce the knowledge,
                    but I will go back to it asap, since that's where the real knowledge is on. I am just building the
